The Nyx Zone is my personal website, the main site of my collective of websites, and a hub of my presence on the Web.

## Why

Between aborted versions, different versions, updates, and projects, my directory structure for my personal and fan websites is becoming a giant tangled nest, so to heck with it, version control it is.

Secondly, I want my shrine hobbyist and fansite maker friends at Amassment.ORG to be able to see the source code of my websites, in case of "how did you do that?" ðŸ˜„
