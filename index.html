			<h1 class="title">The Nyx Zone</h1>
			<p>Nice to meet you! 👋</p>
			<p>My name is [Nyx Midnight, Nyx, Nyyyx] 🆔, my pronouns are she/her 🏳️‍🌈, and I have been in online fandom
				since roughly 1998 📅</p>

			<p>Yes, I remember modem dial-up noises ☎️🖥️</p>

			<p>I am primarily known as a writer of fanfiction, but I also draw fanart once in a while, I write meta, I've led
				zine projects, and, as you can see, I code websites!</p>

			<p>This website right here is both my personal website, as a living breathing creature 🦥 with a presence on the
				Internet, and my site collective's 🗄️ front page and central hub </p>
